   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Building an Executable
â†‘To create a standalone executable for the app, 
- install PyInstaller:
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```
- Generate a spec file:
```bash
pyi-makespec --onefile --windowed --icon=university_logo.ico main.py
```
Then run:
```bash
pyinstaller main.spec
```
The executable will be created in the `dist` folder.
